# Notes

Write a function that given, an array arr, returns an array containing at each index i the amount of numbers that are smaller than arr[i] to the right.

For example:

* Input [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] => Output [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
* Input [1, 2, 0] => Output [1, 1, 0]
If you've completed this one and you feel like testing your performance tuning of this same kata, head over to the much tougher version How many are smaller than me II?

## Plans

Story 1 - User can pass in wrong input or empty array, it should return exception or empty array
 - âœ… UAT 1.1 - when given string, it should return exception
 - âœ… UAT 1.2 - when given empty array, it should return [0]
 - âœ… UAT 1.3 - when given integer, it should return exception

Story 2 - User can pass in 1 number, it should return [0]
 - âœ… UAT 2.1 - when given [1], it should return [0]
 - âœ… UAT 2.2 - when given [0], it should return [0]
 - âœ… UAT 2.3 - when given [10], it should return [0]

Story 3 - User can pass in 2 same numbers
 - âœ… UAT 3.1 - when given [0,0], it should return [0,0]
 - âœ… UAT 3.2 - when given [1,1], it should return [0,0]
 - âœ… UAT 3.3 - when given [2,2], it should return [0,0]

Story 4 - User can pass in 2 different numbers, first is smaller
 - âœ… UAT 4.1 - when given [0,1], it should return [0,0]
 - âœ… UAT 4.2 - when given [1,2], it should return [0,0]
 - âœ… UAT 4.3 - when given [9,10], it should return [0,0]

Story 5 - User can pass in 2 different numbers, second is smaller
 - âœ… UAT 5.1 - when given [1,0], it should return [1,0]
 - âœ… UAT 5.2 - when given [4,3], it should return [1,0]
 - âœ… UAT 5.3 - when given [9,3], it should return [1,0]

Story 6 - User can pass in 3 same numbers 
 - âœ… UAT 6.1 - when given [5, 5, 5], it should return [0,0,0]

Story 7 - User can pass in 3 numbers from smaller to higher order  
 - âœ… UAT 7.1 - when given [0, 5, 10], it should return [0,0,0]

Story 8 - User can pass in 3 numbers from higher to smaller order  
 - âœ… UAT 8.1 - when given [10, 9, 8], it should return [2,1,0]

Story 9 - User can pass in 3 numbers, middle is higher then other 2 (those are same)
 - âœ… UAT 9.1 - when given [8, 9, 8], it should return [0,1,0]

Story 10 - User can pass in 3 numbers, first two are higher then the last
 - âœ… UAT 10.1 - when given [9, 9, 8], it should return [1,1,0]

Story 11 - User can pass in 3 numbers, last two are higher then the first
 - âœ… UAT 11.1 - when given [1, 2, 2], it should return [0,0,0]
